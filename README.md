This is my **first web scraping project**, where I collected **live gold and silver prices** and prepared them for analysis and visualization.

## 🔧 Project Workflow  

1. **Web Scraping with Python** 
   - Scraped a website to extract:  
     - **Buy & Sell prices** 💲  
     - **Daily trend (Up/Down)** ↗️ ↘️  
     - **Exact value of price change** 💱  

2. **Data Export** 📁  
   - Saved the extracted data into a **CSV file** for further processing.  

3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** 🧹  
   - Used **Power Query** to clean and format the dataset for analysis.
