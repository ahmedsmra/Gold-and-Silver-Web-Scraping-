# Gold-and-Silver-Web-Scraping-Project

I built my first web scraping project where I collected live data on gold and silver prices. 🥇 🥈 



Using Python, I scraped the website to extract: 



Buy & Sell prices 💲 



Daily trend (Up/Down) ↗️ ↘️ 



The exact value of the price change 💱 



After that, I exported the data into a CSV file. 📁 



Then, using Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the dataset to make it ready for analysis. 🧼 



Finally, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the data clearly
